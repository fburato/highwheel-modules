## [Unreleased]

First version of the standalone project. The original release has been made in [my fork of Henry's highwheel](https://github.com/fburato/highwheel) project but after discussing the matter with Henry, we decided to split them. This is due to various reasons:

- Highwheel aim is class visualisation. Highwheel-Modules focuses on static analysis. As a Cthulhu High Priest and a separation of concerns maniac, this seemed wrong to me. So, here we are :)
- I want to keep updating Highwheel-Modules and release versions independently of the direction of Highwheel. Considering I don't want to burden Henry more than absolutely necessary with pull requests and such, I'd rather take 100% responsibility on the maintenance of the project.
- I'd really like this project to be adopted to the wider Java/Scala/Kotlin community because I think it can be useful to fill execution the gap between software architecture and software development. Having a dedicated project with its own documentation and a laser focus on its main purpose I believe will be beneficial to the adoption.
