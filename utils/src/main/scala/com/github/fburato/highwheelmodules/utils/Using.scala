    *       for the creation of custom resources, and to call `acquire` during those
    *       resources' construction. Doing so guarantees that the resource ''must'' be
    *       automatically managed, and makes it impossible to forget to do so.
    *
    *       Example:
    *       {{{
    *       class SafeFileReader(file: File)(implicit manager: Using.Manager)
    *         extends BufferedReader(new FileReader(file)) {
